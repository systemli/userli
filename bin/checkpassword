# Example Dovecot checkpassword script that may be used as both passdb or userdb.
#
# Originally written by Nikolay Vizovitin, 2013.

# Assumes authentication DB is in /etc/dovecot/users, each line has '<user>:<password>' format.
# Place this script into /etc/dovecot/checkpassword.sh file and make executable.
# Implementation guidelines at http://wiki2.dovecot.org/AuthDatabase/CheckPassword

# The first and only argument is path to checkpassword-reply binary.
# It should be executed at the end if authentication succeeds.

# Messages to stderr will end up in mail log (prefixed with "dovecot: auth: Error:")
#LOG=/vagrant/checkpassword.log

# User and password will be supplied on file descriptor 3.

# Error return codes.
ERR_PERMFAIL=1
ERR_NOUSER=3
ERR_TEMPFAIL=111
