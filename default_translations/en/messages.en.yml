    Dear user,

    Welcome aboard. You can find guides for setting up your e-mail account
    with several client programs on the Internet.

    You get a mailbox with a 1 GB quota. If you exceed your limit,
    your e-mail account may not function properly.

    In one week you will receive three invite codes, which you can collect
    at %app_url%/voucher. You can pass these on to friends and
    invite them to register with %project_name%.

    Sincerly,
    your %project_name% admin team.
  recovery-subject: The password for your e-mail account %email% will be reset
  recovery-body: |
    Hello %email%,

    Your account password has been attemptedly reset by authenticating with
    your  e-mail address and corresponding recovery code at
    %app_url%/recovery.

    If this wasn't you, then somebody else with access to your recovery
    token tried to get ahold of your account. Go to
    %app_url%/user/recovery_token immediately and create a
    new recovery token. This will invalidate the old recovery token and stop
    the process.

    If you did trigger the process yourself, the 48 hour waiting period started
    now. It will end at %time%. Afterwards, you can set a new password at
    %app_url%/recovery.

    We hope you continue to enjoy your e-mail account.
    Your %project_name% admin team.
