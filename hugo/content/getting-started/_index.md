The easiest way to install Userli on a fresh Debian Buster is running these commands:

    # install dependencies
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ansible git python3-pip
    sudo pip3 install molecule  # re-run in case of error

    # get code
    git clone https://github.com/systemli/ansible-role-userli.git
    cd ansible-role-userli

    # install apache2, mariadb, php7.4 and userli
    sudo molecule converge -s localhost

This installs all dependencies, creates a database and database user
(name: userli, password: userli), and installs the userli code at `/var/www/userli`.
It is accessible via [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
There, you can create the first domain and user for your instance.

Next, you would have to change the password of the database user,
[configure your instance](../installation/configuration),
and probably install Dovecot to do anything meaningful.

Better, do a [manual installation](../installation) to understand each part of your
configuration.
